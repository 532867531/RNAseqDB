expected_count
--------------
The maximum likelihood gene expression levels estimated using RSEM, i.e. the expected_count in RSEMâ€™s output. It can be provided to programs such as EBSeq, DESeq, or edgeR to identify differentially expressed genes. Here, expression of only protein coding genes was provided.


unnormalized
--------------
Gene expression levels (FPKM) calculated using RSEM. The data in this folder underwent quantile normalization, but was not corrected batch effects.


normalized
--------------
Normalized gene expression levels (FPKM) calculated using RSEM. The data in this folder not only underwent quantile normalization, but also was batch effect corrected (using ComBat).
