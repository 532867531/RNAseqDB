# Description:
#  1. This file is used to match GTEx tissues with TCGA tissues.
#  2. Tissues in the same cluster are processed together using post-process.pl,
#     which calls ComBat for batch effect correction.
#  3. Batch numbers are used directly by ComBat to fix biases between batches.
#  4. Tissue directory names match the texts in columns GTEx_Tissue/TCGA_Tissue. 
#  5. If a cluster includes different tissues, specify each in the last column to
#     preserve tissue infomation. If a tissue serves as control, then use 'control'
#     as its tissue type so that tumors are not used in batch effect correction.
