# Description:
#  1. This file is used to match GTEx tissues with TCGA tissues.
#  2. Tissues with same cluster number are processed in a single run by
#     run-combat.pl, which calls ComBat for batch effect correction.
#  3. Batch number is used directly by ComBat to fix biases between batches.
#  4. Tissue directory names should be the same as the words in column 2/3.
